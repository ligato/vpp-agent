# Maximum duration for reading the entire request, including the body. Because read timeout does not let handlers
# make per-request decisions on each request body's acceptable deadline or upload rate, most users will prefer
# to use read-header-timeout. It is valid to use them both. Read timeout is set in nanoseconds.
read-timeout: 0

# Header timeout is the amount of time allowed to read request headers. The connection's read deadline is reset
# after reading the headers and the Handler can decide what is considered too slow for the body. Read header
# timeout is set in nanoseconds.
read-header-timeout: 0

# WriteTimeout is the maximum duration before timing out writes of the response. It is reset whenever a new
# request's header is read. Like ReadTimeout, it does not let Handlers make decisions on a per-request basis.
# Write timeout is set in nanoseconds.
write-timeout: 0

# Maximum amount of time to wait for the next request when keep-alives are enabled. If idle timeout is zero,
# the value of ReadTimeout is used. If both are zero, there is no timeout. Idle timeout is set in nanoseconds.
idle-timeout: 0

# Field controls the maximum number of bytes the server will read parsing the request header's keys and values,
# including the request line. It does not limit the size of the request body.
