# Tutorial: Working with KV Data Stores

In this tutorial we will learn how to use an external key-value (KV) data store.
The tutorial shows how to read and write data to/from the data store and how to 
watch for changes. 

Requirements:
* Complete and understand the ['Hello World Agent'](01_hello-world.md) tutorial
* Complete and understand the ['Plugin Dependencies'](02_plugin-deps.md) tutorial

We will be using [Etcd][1] as the KV data store, but the Ligato infrastructure 
support several other key-value data stores: [Consul][2], [BoltDB][3], [FileDB][4], 
[Redis][5].

The common interface for all key-value store implementations is `KvProtoPlugin`, 
defined in [`cn-infra/db/keyval/plugin_api_keyval.go`][7]:

```go
type KvProtoPlugin interface {
	NewBroker(keyPrefix string) ProtoBroker
	NewWatcher(keyPrefix string) ProtoWatcher
	Disabled() bool
	OnConnect(func() error)
	String() string
}
```

To use the Etcd as our KV data store plugin we simply define a field for the 
`KvProtoPlugin` interface in our plugin and initialize it with an Etcd plugin 
instance in our plugin's constructor. Note that we use the default Etcd plugin
(`etcd.DefaultPlugin`). In other words, we basically create a dependency on
the KV data store in our plugin and satisfy it with the default Etcd KV data
store implementation:

```go
type MyPlugin struct {
	infra.PluginDeps
	KVStore keyval.KvProtoPlugin
}

func NewMyPlugin() *MyPlugin {
	// ...
	p.KVStore = &etcd.DefaultPlugin
	return p
}
```

Once we have the appropriate KV data store plugin, we can create a broker which
will be the facade (mediator) through which we will communicate with the data 
store. The broker hides the complexity of interacting with the different data 
stores and gives us a simple read/write API. 

The broker must be initialized with a key prefix that becomes the root for the
kv tree that the broker will operate on. The broker uses the key prefix for all
of  its operations (Get, List, Put, Delete). In this example we will use `/myplugin/`.

```go
broker := p.KVStore.NewBroker("/myplugin/")
```

Note: The Etcd plugin must be configured with the address of the Etcd server. This
is typically done through the etcd config file. In most cases, the etcd config 
file must be in the same folder where the agent executable is started. If the etcd
config file is not found, the Etcd plugin will be disabled, and you will see 
and error log like this:
```
level=error msg="KV store is disabled" loc="04_kv-store/main.go(41)" logger=defaultLogger
```

The broker accepts `proto.Message` parameters in its methods, therefore we need to
define a Protobuf model for data that we want to put in and read from the data store.
For this tutorial we define a very simple model - `Greetings`. You can find it in
the [`model.proto`][6] file.

```proto
message Greetings {
    string greeting = 1;
}
```
Note: it is a good practice to put all Protobuf definitions for a plugin in a 
`model` directory.

Next, we need to generate Go code from our model. We will use the generated Go 
structures as parameters in calls to the broker. The code generation is controlled
from the `go:generate` directive; since we only have one go file in this tutorial,
we put the directive there:

```go
//go:generate protoc --proto_path=model --go_out=model ./model/model.proto
```
Note that the above directive assumes that we use the golang protbuf generator,
the source protobuf files can be found in the model directory and the
generated files will also be put into the model directory. Note also that to
use the golang protobuf generator, you must install it on your machine as
described, for example, [here](https://github.com/golang/protobuf).

We use the go compiler to generate Go files from the model. In the tutorial Type:
```
go generate
``` 
Go generate must be run explicitly. It scans go files in the current path for
the `generate` directives and then invokes the protobuf compiler. In our 
tutorial, `go generate` will create the file `model.pb.go`.

Now we can finally use the generated Go structures to update a value in the 
KV data store. We will use the broker's `Put` method:

```go
value := &model.Greetings{
	Greeting: "Hello",
}
err := broker.Put("greetings/hello", value)
if err != nil {
	// handle error
}
```

The value above will be updated for key `/myplugin/greetings/hello`.

To retrieve a value from a KV store we will use broker's `GetValue` method:

```go
value := new(model.Greetings)
found, rev, err := broker.GetValue("greetings/hello", value)
if err != nil {
	// handle error
}else if !found {
	// handle not found
}
```

To watch for changes in the KV store we need to initialize a watcher:

```go
watcher := p.KVStore.NewWatcher("/myplugin/")
```

Then we need to define our callback function that will process the changes:

```go
onChange := func(resp keyval.ProtoWatchResp) {
	key := resp.GetKey()
	value := new(model.Greetings)
	if err := resp.GetValue(value); err != nil {
		// handle error
	}
	// process change
}
```

Now we can start watching for a key prefix(es):

```go
cancelWatch := make(chan string)
err := watcher.Watch(onChange, cancelWatch, "greetings/")
if err != nil {
	// handle error
}
```

The channel `cancelWatch` can be used to cancel watching.
