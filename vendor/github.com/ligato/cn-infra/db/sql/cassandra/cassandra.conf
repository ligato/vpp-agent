# ProtoVersion sets the version of the native protocol to use, this will
# enable features in the driver for specific protocol versions, generally this
# should be set to a known version (2,3,4) for the cluster being connected to.
# If it is 0 or unset (the default) then the driver will attempt to discover the
# highest supported protocol for the cluster. In clusters with nodes of different
# versions the protocol selected is not defined (ie, it can be any of the supported in the cluster)
