# Flavors

A [flavor](../docs/guidelines/PLUGIN_FLAVORS.md) is a reusable
collection of plugins with initialized
[dependencies](../docs/guidelines/PLUGIN_DEPENDENCIES.md).

The most importatnt CN-Infra flavors are:
* [local flavor](local) - a minimal set of plugins. It is used to just
   initialize logging & statuscheck. It is useful for embedding agent
   plugins into different projects that use their own infrastructure.
* [RPC flavor](rpc) - a collection of plugins that expose RPCs.
  It also registers management APIs for:
  * status check (RPCs probed from systems such as K8s)
  * logging (for changing log level at runtime remotely)
* [connectors flavor](connectors) - is combination of ETCD, Cassandra,
  Redis & Kafka related plugins.
  
The following diagram depicts:
* plugins that are parts of a specific flavor
* the initialized (injected) [statuscheck](../health/statuscheck)
  dependency within the [etcd client plugin](../db/keyval/etcdv3)
  and the [Kafka client plugin](../messaging/kafka)
* the [local flavor](local) embedded in:
    * [all connectors flavor](connectors) 
    * [RPC flavor](rpc)
