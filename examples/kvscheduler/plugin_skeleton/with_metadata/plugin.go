/*******************************************************************************
 Feel free to use this skeleton of a VPP-Agent plugin with a single descriptor
 and a metadata index-map to build your own plugin in 6 steps:
  1. for each of your value types (e.g. interface, route, ...), define a separate
     protobuf message to carry the value data:
      - use the attached bare value definition, provided in model/model.proto
        as "Value", to start from
      - rename the proto message and the file appropriately, such that it is
        clear to which value type it belongs
      - for each of your value types, write a separate proto file
      - replicate and update the go:generate comment below (*) for each of your
        proto messages
      - when done, re-generate the golang code for the proto messages with
        `go generate .`
  2. define model for each of your value types in model/keys.go, which will be
     then used by the agent and the descriptor to build and parse keys for value
     instances
  3. use "metaidx" as a template for implementing your own index maps with
     secondary lookups over your metadata
      - note: if you only to keep an integer SB handle with each value instance,
              you may instead re-use the ligato/vpp-agent/pkg/idxvpp map, even
              if SB is not actually VPP (metadata type is a structure called
              "OnlyIndex") - for an example see descriptor for VPP bridge domains,
              located in ligato/vpp-agent/plugins/vpp/l2plugin/descriptor
  4. for each of your value types, including derived types (with the exception
     of derived properties), implement one descriptor in the "descriptor"
     sub-package:
      - first replicate and update the go:generate comment below (**) to generate
        adapter for every descriptor to be implemented
      - generate new/updated adapters with `go generate .`
        (don't forget to remove skeleton.go adapter attached as an example)
      - use the attached skeleton descriptor to start from
      - please rename the descriptor(s) and the file(s), such that it is clear
        to which value type each of them belongs
      - implement CRUD methods and other attributes of the descriptor(s)
      - please remove callbacks/attributes which are not needed/relevant, or
        for which the default behaviour is sufficient
   5. register all your descriptors with KVScheduler in the Init method of the
      plugin
   6. finally, remove comments whose purpose was solely to guide you through
      the process of implementing a new plugin - like this one
      - make sure the remaining comments have no mention of the word "skeleton"

Beware: Extensive copy-pasting is actually a bad practise, so use the skeleton
        with caution and eventually learn how to write your own plugins from the
        scratch, using the skeleton only as a reference.
