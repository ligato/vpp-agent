Please note that the content of this repository is currently **WORK IN PROGRESS**.

The VPP Agent is a Golang implementation of a control/management plane for 
[VPP][1] based cloud-native [Virtual Network Functions][2] (VNFs). The VPP
Agent is built on top of the [CN-Infra platform][16] for developing 
cloud-native Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). 

The VPP Agent can be used as-is as a management/control agent for VNFs 
based on off-the-shelf VPP (for example, a VPP-based vswitch), or as a
platform for developing customized VNFs with customized VPP-based data.

## Architecture
The VPP Agent is basically a set of VPP-specific plugins that use the 
CN-Infra platform to interact with other services / microservices in the
cloud (e.g. a KV data store, messaging, log warehouse, etc.). The VPP Agent
exposes VPP functionality to client apps via a higher-level model-driven 
API. Clients that consume this API may be either external (connecting to 
the VPP Agent via REST, gRPC API, Etcd or message bus transport), or local
Apps and/or Extension plugins running on the same CN-Infra platform in the 
same Linux process. 

The VNF Agent architecture is shown in the following figure: 

![vpp agent](docs/imgs/vpp_agent.png "VPP Agent & its Plugins on top of cn-infra")

Each (northbound) VPP API - L2, L3, ACL, ... - is implemented by a specific
VNF Agent plugin, which translates northbound API calls/operations into 
(southbound) low level VPP Binary API calls. Northbound APIs are defined 
using [protobufs][3], which allow for the same functionality to be accessible
over multiple transport protocols (HTTP, gRPC, Etcd, ...). Plugins use the 
[GoVPP library][4] to interact with the VPP.

The following figure shows the VPP Agent in context of a cloud-native VNF, 
where the VNF's data plane is implemented using VPP/DPDK and its management
/ control planes are implemented using the VNF agent:

## Plugins
 
The set of plugins in the VPP Agent is as follows:
* [Default VPP Plugins][5] - plugins providing northbound APIs to "default" 
  VPP functionality (i.e. VPP functions available "out-of-the-box"): 
  * [NET Interfaces][6] - network interface configuration (PCI Ethernet, MEMIF, 
    AF_Packet, VXLAN, Loopback...) + BFD
  * [L2][7] - Bridge Domains, L2 cross-connects
  * [L3][8] - IP Routes, VRFs...
  * [ACL][9] - VPP access lists (VPP ACL plugin)
* [GOVPPmux][10] - plugin wrapper around GoVPP. Multiplexes plugins' access to
  VPP on a single connection.
* [Linux][11] (VETH) - allows optional configuration of Linux virtual ethernet 
  interfaces
* [CN-Infra datasync][12] - data synchronization after HA events
* [CN-Infra core][13] - lifecycle management of plugins (loading, 
  initialization, unloading)
* [RESTAPI](plugins/restplugin) - allows to run VPP CLI commands and also provides API to expose existing Northbound objects

## Tools
The VPP agent repository also contains tools for building and troubleshooting 
of VNFs based on the VPP Agent:

* [agentctl](cmd/agentctl) - a CLI tool that shows the state of a set of 
   VPP agents can configure the agents
* [vpp-agent-ctl](cmd/vpp-agent-ctl) - a utility for testing VNF Agent 
  configuration. It contains a set of pre-defined configurations that can 
  be sent to the VPP Agent either interactively or in a script. 
* [docker](docker) - container-based development environment for the VPP
  agent and for app/extension plugins.

## Quickstart
For a quick start with the VPP Agent, you can use pre-built Docker images with
the Agent and VPP on [Dockerhub][14].

0. Start ETCD and Kafka on your host (e.g. in Docker as described [here][15]).
   Note: **The Agent in the pre-built Docker image will not start if it can't 
   connect to both Etcd and Kafka**.

1. Run VPP + VPP Agent in a Docker image:
```
docker pull ligato/vpp-agent
docker run -it --name vpp --rm ligato/vpp-agent
```

2. Configure the VPP agent using agentctl:
```
docker exec -it vpp agentctl -h
```

3. Check the configuration (using agentctl or directly using VPP console):
```
docker exec -it vpp agentctl -e 172.17.0.1:2379 show
docker exec -it vpp vppctl -s localhost:5002
```
