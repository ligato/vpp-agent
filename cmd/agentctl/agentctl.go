// agentctl is a command-line tool for monitoring and configuring VPP Agents.
// The tool connects to an Etcd instance, discovers VPP Agents connected
// to the instance and monitors their status. The tool can also write VPP Agent
// configuration into etcd. Note that the VPP Agent does not have
// to be connected to Etcd for agenctl to be able to change its configuration,
// the agent will simply receive the config with all the changes when it
// connects.
