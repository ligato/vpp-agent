Learn how to use, deploy and develop with VPP Agent.

### What is VPP Agent?

The VPP Agent is a Go implementation of a control/management plane for [VPP][1fdio-vpp] based
cloud-native [Virtual Network Functions][vnf] (VNFs). The VPP Agent is built on top of 
[CN Infra][cn-infra], a framework for developing cloud-native VNFs (CNFs).

The VPP Agent can be used as-is as a management/control agent for VNFs  based on off-the-shelf
VPP (e.g. a VPP-based vswitch), or as a framework for developing management agents for VPP-based
CNFs. An example of a custom VPP-based CNF is the [Contiv-VPP][contivvpp] vswitch.
