# VPP plugins
 
 VPP plugins manage basic configuration of the VPP. The management of configuration is split among multiple
 packages. Detailed description can be found in particular READMEs:
 - [aclplugin](aclplugin)
 - [ifplugin](ifplugin)
 - [l2plugin](l2plugin)
 - [l3plugin](l3plugin)
 - [l4plugin](l4plugin)
 - [srplugin](srplugin)
 
# Config file 

 The default plugins can use configuration file `vpp.conf` to:
  * set global maximum transmission unit 
  * enable/disable stopwatch
  * set VPP resync strategy
  * to enable/disable status publishers
  
  To run the vpp-agent with vpp.conf:
   
   `vpp-agent --vpp-plugin-config=/opt/vpp-agent/dev/vpp.conf`
  
 *MTU*
 
 If there is an interface without MTU set, the value from configuration file will be used. MTU is written in config 
 as follows:
 
 `mtu: <value>`
 
 *Stopwatch*
 
 Duration of the VPP binary api call can be measured using stopwatch feature. These data are logged after 
 every event(any resync, interfaces, bridge domains, fib entries etc.). Enable stopwatch in vpp.conf: 
 
  `stopwatch: true` or  `stopwatch: false`
  
 Stopwatch is disabled by default (if there is no config available). 
 
 *Resync Strategy*
 
 There are two strategies available for VPP resync:
 * **full** always performs the full resync of all VPP plugins. This is the default strategy. 
 * **optimize-cold-start** evaluates the existing configuration in the VPP at first. The state of interfaces is the 
 decision-maker: if there is any interface configured except local0, the resync is performed normally. Otherwise 
 it is skipped.  
 IMPORTANT NOTE: Use it carefully because the state of the ETCD is not taken into consideration .
 
 Strategy can be set in vpp.conf:
 
 `strategy: full` or  `strategy: optimize`
 
 To **skip resync** completely, start vpp-agent with `--skip-vpp-resync` parameter. In such a case the resync is skipped 
 completly (config file resync strategy is not taken into account). 

 *Status Publishers*

 Status Publishers define list of data syncs to which status is published.

 `status-publishers: [<datasync>, <datasync2>, ...]`

 Currently supported data syncs for publishing state: `etcd` and `redis`.
