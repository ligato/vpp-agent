// KVScheduler synchronizes the *desired* system state described by northbound
// (NB) components via transactions with the *actual* state of the southbound (SB).
// The  system state is represented as a set of inter-dependent key-value pairs
// that can be created, updated, deleted from within NB transactions or be notified
// about via notifications from the SB plane.
// The scheduling basically implements "state reconciliation" - periodically and
// on any change the scheduler attempts to update every value which has satisfied
// dependencies but is out-of-sync with the desired state given by NB.
//
// For the scheduler, the key-value pairs are just abstract items that need
// to be managed in a synchronized fashion according to the described relations.
// It is up to the SB components to assign actual meaning to the individual
// values via provided implementations for CRUD operations.
//
// The idea behind scheduler is based on the Mediator pattern - SB components
// do not communicate directly, but instead interact through the mediator.
// This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby reducing
// coupling.
//
// The values are described for scheduler by registered KVDescriptor-s.
// The scheduler learns two kinds of relations between values that have to be
// respected by the scheduling algorithm:
//   -> A depends on B:
//          - A cannot exist without B
//          - request to create A without B existing must be postponed by storing
//            A into the cache of values with unmet dependencies (a.k.a. pending)
//          - if B is to be removed and A exists, A must be removed first
//            and cached in case B is restored in the future
//          - Note: values pushed from SB are not checked for dependencies
//   -> B is derived from A:
//          - value B is not created directly (by NB or SB) but gets derived
//            from base value A (using the DerivedValues() method of the base
//            value's descriptor)
//          - derived value exists only as long as its base does and gets removed
//            (without caching) once the base value goes away
//          - derived value may be described by a different descriptor than
//            the base and usually represents property of the base value (that
//            other values may depend on) or an extra action to be taken
//            when additional dependencies are met.
//
// Every key-value pair must have at most one descriptor associated with it.
// Base NB value without descriptor is considered unimplemented and will never
// be created.
// On the other hand, derived value is allowed to have no descriptor associated
// with it. Typically, properties of base values are implemented as derived
// (often empty) values without attached SB operations, used as targets for
// dependencies.
//
// For descriptors the values are mutable objects - Create, Update and Delete
// methods should reflect the value content without changing it.
// To add and maintain extra (runtime) attributes alongside the value, scheduler
// allows descriptors to append metadata - of any type - to each created
// non-derived Object value. Descriptor can also use the metadata to define
// secondary lookups, exposed via MetadataMap.
//
// Advantages of the centralized scheduling are:
//   - easy to add new descriptors and dependencies
//   - decreases the likelihood of race conditions and deadlocks in systems with
//     complex dependencies
//   - allows to write loosely-coupled SB components (mediator pattern)
//   - descriptor API will force new SB components to follow the same
//     code structure which will make them easier to familiarize with
//   - NB components should never worry about dependencies between requests -
//     it is taken care of by the scheduler
//   - single cache for all (not only pending) values (exposed via REST,
//     easier to debug)
//
// Apart from scheduling and execution, KVScheduler also offers the following
// features:
//   - collecting and counting present and past errors individually for every
//     key
//   - retry for previously failed actions
//   - transaction reverting
//   - exposing history of actions, errors and past value revisions over the REST
//     interface
//   - clearly describing the sequence of actions to be executed and postponed
//     in the log file
//   - allows to print verbose log messages describing graph traversal during
//     transactions for debugging purposes
//   - exposing graph snapshot, in the present state or after a given transaction,
//     as a plotted graph (returned via REST) with values as nodes (colored to
//     distinguish various value states) and dependencies/derivations as edges.
