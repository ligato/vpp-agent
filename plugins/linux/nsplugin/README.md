## Linux namespace plugin

Auxiliary plugin used mainly by other plugins to handle namespaces and microservices.

### Namespaces

Agent has full support for Linux network namespaces. It is possible to attach Linux interface into a new, existing
or even yet-to-be-created network namespace via the `namespace` configuration section inside the `LinuxInterfaces` configuration data model.

Namespace can be referenced in multiple ways. The most low-level link to a namespace is
a file descriptor associated with the symbolic link automatically created in the `proc` filesystem, pointing to the definition
of the namespace used by a given process (`/proc/<PID>/ns/net`) or by a task of a given process (`/proc/<PID>/task/<TID>/ns/net`).
A more common approach to reference namespace is to use just the PID of the process whose
namespace we want to attach to, or to create a bind-mount of the symbolic link into `/var/run/netns` directory and use the
filename of that mount. The latter is called `named` namespace and it is created and managed for example by
the `ip netns` command line tool from the `iproute2` package. The advantage of `named` namespace
is that it can outlive the process it was originally created by.

`namespace` configuration section should be seen as a union of values. First, set the type and then store the reference
into the appropriate field (`pid` vs. `name` vs `microservice`).
Agent supports both PID-based references as well as `named` namespaces.

### Microservices

Additionally, we provide a non-standard namespace reference, denoted as `MICROSERVICE_REF_NS`, which is specific to ecosystems
with microservices. It is possible to attach interface into the namespace of a container that runs microservice with a given label.
To make it even simpler, it is not required to start the microservice before the interface is configured. The agent will postpone
interface (re)configuration until the referenced microservice gets launched. Behind the scenes, the agent communicates with
the docker daemon to construct and maintain an up-to-date map of microservice labels to PIDs and IDs of their corresponding
containers. Whenever a new microservice is detected, all pending interfaces are moved to its namespace.
