// Netalloc allows to disassociate topology from addressing in the network
// configuration. Instead of inserting specific IP/MAC addresses, VXLAN VNIs, etc.,
// into the configuration data for interfaces, routes, ARPs and other network
// objects, the addresses can be symbolic references into the pool of allocated
// addresses known to the netalloc plugin.
//
// The ability to separate addresses from the rest of the network configuration
// is especially useful in scenarios where address allocations are provided
// externally, for example by another control-plane agent, IPAM tool or by CNI
// in containerized environments.
//
// But for now, only model for IP address allocations has been implemented.
// To allocate a new IP address, an instance of the proto message IPAllocation
// should be submitted into the vpp-agent through one of the supported NB
// transports (etcd, GRPC, ...) under the corresponding key. Network object which
// references (to-be or already) allocated address will have a dependency on the
// corresponding key-value instance of IPAllocation and will read and apply the
// address only once it is available.
